A prototype for a project in the course IN1050 Intro to Interaction Design

Uses the Responsive Voice text-to-speech API to simulate a system the user can talk to. 

When evaluating the prototype, the evaluator interprets the user's voice commands and selects the appropriate button in this prototype, producing a spoken response. If no appropriate response exists, the evaluator can type it in.
